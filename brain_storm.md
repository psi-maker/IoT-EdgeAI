This document intend to analysis the structured design for AI-traffic, education, cooking, ninght vision. Focusing on their generic technology, I/O, hardware, software, network, etc.

# Smart Traffic
## Sensor fusion option
The best way for sensors installation is moveable.
* infrared thermal imaging sensors for pedestrain, animal, or other thermal objects: used for severe weather, less light  
* Dual vision camera: used for point cloud, three dimension process  
* Audio system: voice I/O  
* LiDAR: long distance
## Structure and Application
To avoid communication jam between equipments and useless data, sensors should be integrated with edge devices. Edge devices do basic AI analysis in high speed, send the result or possible alert information to central app/database for storage or further identification.  
  
Traffic is too different to use only DL, DL is the basic AI analysis such as: object category, road scenario etc. RL with evolution mechanism need be used for complex situation such as abnormal situation,possible accident prerequisite,the main purpose should be forcast near future and alert rather than only find accident.  
  
I think the important point for smart traffic system is the simulation backbone system, which is used for AR/VR/node.js future simulation per matrix world calculation, real world physical law, and weather condition, as well as integrate the edge devices' result, then feedback to edge devices and alert possible accident objects.  
  
# GARBAGE SORTING AND SEPARATION
Garbage sorting and separation system is simple to compare with other system, but the facility is a big problem. Following options are possible implementation for public facilities:  
1. pre-construction of garbage system underground when building a house  
2. A facility with vertical space rather than landscape orientation outdoor  
3. A manipulator on the facility can easily seperate different objects  
4. Maybe simple process facility can be integrated with the faciliy such as paper smash, liquid drying, or food smash, etc. This will simplify following transportation and process system cost.  

# AI Education
People have strong memories with picture and shape rather than sentence and words per the biological theory.  
One edge AI equipment with screen or AR/VR can recognize people talk with NLP, gathers related picture or cubic information from central servers, and make it visible will reinforce the learning curve or human communication.  
  
The most important part for AI education is the stereoscopic technology, NLP, vision or others consist with human brain running way.  

# Smart Cooking
# Sensors
TellSpec equipment is a good reference for food ingredient detection, which use spectrometer scan to identify anaphylactogen,chemical substances, nutrient content and quantity of heat  https://tellspec.com/tw/

# Structure and Application
* Include the sensor to examine ingredients, the system also suggest the options of recipes on food materials by screen.   
* The best way for this system is to integrate with a health system, by that the system can suggest optimized food, recipes against everyone's physical body condition.  
* Even more, the system can control other kitchen equipment, such as the microwave timing, cooking timing etc.

# DevOps, coding tools
> **Local coding**
>> Hardware: https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit/hardware  
>> Software OpenVINO: https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit
>>> Document: https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html  
>>> Toolkit: https://github.com/opencv/dldt Designed to accelerate the development of applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on (CNN), the toolkit extends workloads across Intel hardware (including accelerators) and maximizes performance.

> **Cloud coding** No hardware setup required on your end. The DevCloud utilizes Jupyter* Notebooks to execute code directly within the Web browser. https://devcloud.intel.com/edge/home
